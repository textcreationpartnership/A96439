         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE Reaſon why I preſume ſo high in my Dedication, is, you being his Vicegerents on Earth, are the great Inſtruments in GOD's Hand, who can Cure the Nation of its Malady, and Heal the Languiſhing Diſeaſes, and ſo make up the Breaches thereof; which if GOD is pleaſed (tho' now at laſt) to honour you with this great Work of Reformation, to advance the Kingdom of CHRIST in the Earth, you will not only give occaſion to your Deareſt Friends, but your greateſt Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies ſhall Bleſs, Praiſe, and Magnifie the LORD of Lords on your behalf, for then ſhall that Prayer be anſwered, <hi>Thy King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom come, and Thy Will be done, in Earth as it is in Heaven;</hi> and will not this be a Glorious Day, when inſtead of Killing

Holineſs becomes thy Houſe, O LORD, and the place where thine Honour dwelleth;</hi> and thus was his whole Life a Life of Prayer and Praiſe, and admiring the LORD in all his wonderful VVorks. Again, as <hi>David</hi> was, as it were, proud of the LORD, in making his boaſt of him, in vehemently loving him, praiſing, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring, and exalting him above all things Viſible or Inviſible; even ſo doth GOD own <hi>David</hi> before all the VVorld, and
<pb facs="tcp:173009:7"/>makes his boaſts of him; and the good that he did to <hi>Iſrael</hi> was for his Servant <hi>David</hi>'s ſake; for, ſaid the LORD to the Prophet <hi>Ahijah, I will not take the whole Kingdom out of</hi> Solomon<hi>'s hand, but he ſhall be Prince all the Days of his Life, for</hi> David <hi>my Servant's ſake, whom I choſe, becauſe he kept my Commandments, and my Statutes; but I will take the Kingdom out of his Son's hand, for his Father</hi> Solomon<hi>'s Sin; yet I will give him one Tribe, that</hi> David <hi>my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant may have a Light always before me in Jeruſalem;</hi> and ſo the Mercy goes on in his Line till it comes to <hi>Chriſt:</hi> But was this a bare Hiſtorical Service or VVorſhip that GOD was ſo well pleaſed with in him; was it his going to the Temples, and offering Sacrifices? No, for he ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Perſon of Chriſt, ſaid, <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and Offering thou wouldſt not, therefore I come to do thy Will, Oh GOD, in a Body which thou haſt prepared; and,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>the Sacrifice which God requires, is a broken and a contrite Heart,</hi> and this Sacrifice <hi>David</hi> offered plentifully to the LORD in GOD's Houſe, within him in his Soul, in his moſt inward parts, which is GOD's Temple and Dwelling-place; for <hi>Heaven is my
<pb facs="tcp:173009:8"/>Throne, and the Earth my Footſtool, then where is the place of my Reſt? for all theſe things have I made, ſaith the LORD:</hi> And ſaith the Apoſtles, <hi>God dwelleth not in Temples made with hands:</hi> So then that out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Temple</hi> was but a Figure of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Temple, which was deſtroyed with the Glory thereof: And the inner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Sanctuary, where the High-prieſt was only to come, was a Type or Figure of the inward or innermoſt place in the Soul, where GOD will be worſhipped, and whoſe Right it is to have his Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion there, in the Holieſt of Holies; as our Lord and Saviour ſaid to the <hi>Samaritan</hi> Woman, <hi>Ye worſhip ye know not what, the time cometh, and now is, that the Father will be worſhipped neither in this Mountain, or that Mountain, nor at</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>it ſelf, but in Spirit and in Truth; for ſuch the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeeks to worſhip him;</hi> altho' they were to wait at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to receive this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the Father, the Spirit of Truth, which would lead them into all Truth, as their Lord ſaid to them, when their Hearts was fill'd with Sorrow at his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture from them, <hi>It is expedient for you,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that I go away; for if I go not

               </gap>ſdom that you may Reign for Ever; for if Riches be a Poſſeſſion to be deſired in this Life, what is Richer than Wiſdom, that worketh all things? <hi>I,</hi> ſaid Solomon, <hi>preferred her before Scepters and Thrones, and counted Riches nothing in compariſon of her, neither did I compare Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Stones unto her; for all Gold is but a little Gravel, in reſpect of her, and Silver ſhall be counted but Clay before her; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I prayed, and underſtanding was given me, I called, and the Spirit of Wiſdom came into me; for when I perceived I could not enjoy her, except GOD gave her, and that that was a point of Wiſdom to know whoſe Gift ſhe was, then I went unto the Lord and beſought him, and with my whole Heart, I ſaid, O GOD of my Fathers, and LORD of Mercy, which haſt made all things with thy Word, and ordained Man through thy Wiſdom, that he ſhould have Dominion over the Creatures, which thou haſt made, and govern'd the World with Equity and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and executed Judgment with an up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right Heart; give me that Wiſdom which
<pb facs="tcp:173009:18"/>ſitteth by thy Throne, and put me not out from among thy Children; for, tho' a Man be never ſo perfect among the Children of Men, yet, if thy Wiſdom be not with him, he ſhall be nothing regarded: Thy Wiſdom, O Lord, which was with thee when thou made the World, which knew what was acceptable in thy ſight: O ſend her out of thy Holy Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, and from the Throne of thy Glory, that ſhe being preſent may labour with me, that I may know what is acceptable in thy ſight; for otherwiſe who can know thy Counſel, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thy Holy Spirit; for ſo the Ways of them which are upon Earth are reformed, and Men are taught the things that are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant unto thee; and are preſerved through thy Wiſdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So far the VViſdom of <hi>Solomon,</hi> which may give you to underſtand the way he came by all his Excellent and Unheard of VViſdom; he prayed and ſought the Lord with his whole Heart, as <hi>David</hi> his Father did, daily waiting at VViſdom's Gate; and well had it been for him if he had never departed therefrom; which may be a Caution to all Princes to watch and pray, leſt they enter into Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
<pb facs="tcp:173009:18"/>So this is that VViſdom and Power from on High that you are to wait for, O King and Parliament, even the Spirit of Truth to lead you into all Truth, to be with you in Council, to go before you in all your Acts, whether Internal or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal; for without this you can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which will be Acceptable to GOD, or Good Men.</p>
            <p>VVherefore, O Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> let my Council be Acceptable to you, and break off your <hi>Sins by Righteouſneſs, and your Iniquities by ſhewing Mercy to the Poor:</hi> But if you will not receive this Admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I'll weep in ſecret for your Sins; therefore I beſeech you, let not ſuch a Spirit be found in the Parliament Houſe, as ſhall preſume to make a Mock or a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſion at theſe great and weighty Truths, as knowing the Penalty thereof, That <hi>whoſoever falls on that ſtone ſhall be broken, but on whomſoever he falls ſhall be broken to pieces.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next is, if I may be ſo bold to ask, VVhy the Tax is laid ſo heavy upon the Commonalty? I know the Anſwer may be ſoon given, Becauſe the Nation is much

            <p>And further, in the Fear and Dread of the LORD, and in a Holy Zeal for his Glory, I muſt lay the Blood of our Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, Dear, Innocent <hi>Queen,</hi> as heavy as Lead upon your Heads; becauſe you Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led her VVound ſlightily, and Spoke Peace to her, when ſudden Deſtruction was at the Door, as appears at this Day: For how great was the Loving Kindneſs of the LORD, in viſiting her with his Mercy and Truth, declaring to her his Mind and Will; tho' through Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible Veſſels to Eyes of Proud Fleſh, which hath ever been his Way, and for that End, to ſtain the Glory of all Fleſh, that no Fleſh might Glory in his Preſence; As I my ſelf, among the reſt, had the Henour, though Unworthy to be his Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger, to declare his Mind and Will to the late <hi>Queen,</hi> both in Print, and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Writings, all which fully declares the Labour of the Spirit of the <hi>Lord</hi> with her, and that he would have Honoured

After a while I looked, and on a ſudden the <hi>Queen</hi> was down upon the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:173009:34"/>Ground, and all that ſate about her, lay a top of her, as if they would have Cruſh'd her to Death; inſomuch that I Cried out with a Vehement and Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Cry, The <hi>Queen</hi> will be Smothered, what ſhall I do; the <hi>Queen</hi> will be Smo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered? After this ſhe was gone from under them by an Inviſible Hand, none of them knew how, nor whether; they Run to and fro, as Diſtracted, ſeeking her, but could not find her; nor is it to be Expreſt the Diſtreſs I ſaw her Ladies, Prieſts and People, who had lain upon her, in Crying out one to the other for her, but all in vain; for, my thoughts, ſhe was gone to be ſeen no more; I my ſelf ſought her with bitter Mourning, but could not find her.</q>
            </p>
            <p>By the firſt of this ſight, I was given to underſtand, ſhe was under them, and them over her; and therefore could not do what her Pious Heart was Inclined to: The next was, her Removeal from under their Yoke.</p>
            <p>Well is it, I hope, with her, that it is ſo; for the longer ſhe had Continued under their Controuling Power, the worſe it would have been for her, except ſhe
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:173009:34"/>had had Strength to have Obeyed the LORD, rather than them; but to you, Oh ye Prieſts, it is the Judgment of GOD; for Juſt is the LORD in Removing her:</p>
            <p>For you were unworthy of ſuch an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Governeſs, who might have been an admirable Inſtrument in the Hand of the <hi>Lord,</hi> for the Reforming theſe Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtical Nations, and bringing back the People from their Idolatrous Ways, from Worſhipping their Gods of Silver and Gold, and the Work of their own Hands; together with the reſt of the Abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of this Age; as the like had not been in our Memory, had you but Aſſiſted her with good Counſel, to have ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned her weak Hands, and you joyned with her in the Work.</p>
            <p>But, inſtead of being Inſtruments, to put your helping Hand to this great and weighty Work of Reformation, to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Children of Men out of their fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len State into the Glorious Liberty of the Sons of GOD; ſome of you are, and have been the chiefeſt Inſtruments the Devil hath to bring them into Bondage, to ſink them into the Pit of Deſtruction, to damn them into Hell Fire, which is prepared
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:173009:35"/>for the Devil and his Angels, and for all thoſe that forget GOD, ſo as not to keep his Commandments: For is it not ſo, Oh ye Prieſts, when Chriſt our Saviour tells us, <hi>That ſtraight is the Gate, and narrow is the Way that leads to Life, and few there be that find it;</hi> and <hi>that broad is the Way, and wide the Gate that leads to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction:</hi> And <hi>he that taketh not up his Croſs, and followeth not me, is not worthy of me: Take my Yoak upon you, and Learn of me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe are the Commands of CHRIST, Oh ye Prieſts, then what is his <hi>Croſs?</hi> What is it to Learn of him? What is it to bear his Yoak? What is it to deny Self? Is it to go to Plays? Is it to Dance? Is it to Play at Cards? Is it the Pleaſures of Life? <hi>Anſwer,</hi> Ye, Falſe Teachers, are theſe the Croſs of Chriſt, which is the Power of GOD againſt all ſuch Works of Darkneſs, is this to Learn of him, to go to Cards: Do you follow him, when you go to Plays or Dancing? Or do you not follow your Father the Devil, whoſe Works ye will do?</p>
            <p>Oh! ye Runagates, whether are you gone; what Hew and Cry ſhall be ſent
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:173009:35"/>after you, to bring you back to the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church, from whence you are fallen, who are gone ſo far a Whoring from the LORD after your Idols and Inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as to proclaim upon the Houſe top, that the Devil's Works are Innocent.</p>
            <p>Oh ye Adulterers, whom ſhall we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bieve, our Saviour, or you? Our Saviour that Commands us to ſtrive to enter in at the ſtraight Gate; for, ſaith he, that's the Way to Life: Or you that tells us the Pleaſures of Life, that leads to Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, are Innocent.</p>
            <p>Ye, Foreheads of Braſs, with what Face durſt you preſume to Preach ſuch Doctrine in a Pulpit; ſhall Treaſon be Spoke againſt an Earthly Prince, and no notice taken thereof: But you have Spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken high Treaſon againſt the KING of Righteouſneſs, and are ſtirrers up and proclaimers of open Rebellion againſt the <hi>Lord</hi> of Hoſts, and againſt his Anointed <hi>Chriſt:</hi> You are bold indeed. Again, I ſay, ſhall any be ſo Preſumptious to Speak Treaſon againſt an Earthly <hi>King,</hi> and not be call'd to an account: But this Preacher of Lies hath done worſe againſt the King of Eternal Glory, than whatſoever could
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:173009:36"/>acted againſt all the Kings or Monarchs in the World; and yet none hath laid it to Heart, or ſo much as ſaid, What haſt thou done?</p>
            <p>For, as it was in <hi>Jeremiah</hi>'s time, ſo it is now; when the Roul was Burnt, ſaith the Text, <hi>Yet they were not afraid, nor rent their Garments; Neither the King, nor any of his Servants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore, O <hi>England, England,</hi> what Lamentable Lamentation ſhall be taken up for thee; there is not a Man to be found in thy populous Cities, or vaſt Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys, that hath ſo much Zeal for the LORD of Hoſts, as to take this matter in Hand, to Vindicate the Truth of the Everlaſting GOD, with this Uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed Philiſtine, who hath defied the Power of the Living GOD; but every Man taking up his own Quarrel, to plead his own Intereſt; and their fierce Zeal is ſo hot for Self, that they are Sheathing their Swords in one anothers Bowels; which Swords ſhould be turned every one againſt the Enemy of his own Houſe; for that ſhould be the Work of this Day: But contrary to this, here is Brother a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Brother, and Friend againſt Friend,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:173009:36"/>to the great Diſhonour of GOD and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; and being ſo buſied in this Evil Work, they do not mind the Cry that's gone forth. <hi>viz.</hi> Who will be on the <hi>Lord</hi>'s part; who, againſt the Man of Sin, Now Iniquity is filling up to the Brim? Who will come forth to help the LORD, againſt the Mighty?

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:173009:40"/>and great Unworthineſs to lift up your Eyes to him: That thus, by bearing the Indignation of the Lord, you may, if pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, appeaſe his Wrath which is Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led againſt you; that ſo you, beyond all others, by your true and unfeigned Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, by Watchings and Faſtings, and deep Humiliation; for that was the way by which ſome of you came to God in the beginning, when you were little in your own Eyes, and nothing in your own Sight; and that is the way now, by which you muſt come out of your fallen State to God again, by the ſuffering Life of Jeſus; for he is the Way, the Truth, and the Life; and none can come to the Father but by him; by his Suffering Life, by his Death and Bloody Paſſion, both without and within in your Souls, you muſt know the bitter Agony he was in, when he Swet Drops of Blood for your Backſliding from him, or to ſpeak more plain for your Crucifying of him afreſh, and puting him to an open Shame; as witneſs the foreſaid.</p>
            <p>Therefore you, that are guilty of theſe things, come down from your exalted Spirits, and ſit down in the Duſt, and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:173009:40"/>Mourn moſt bitterly, for the Miſeries that is coming upon you, except you ſpeedily Repent.</p>
            <p>And now, to all People every where, both Old and Young, Rich and Poor, that would Inherit Eternal Life and Glory, End<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Joy, Everlaſting Peace and Happineſs to all Eternity, this is your way to obtain it, through the Agony of Chriſt's Internal Sufferings; this is Chriſt, the Way, the Truth, and the Life; and none can come to the Father but by this Way: He that goes another way, than through the Ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his Soul, is a Thief and a Robber, and comes but to Steal, as our Saviour ſaith.</p>
            <p>Mark that, To take that which is none of his own; but he that feels it in his own Soul, it's his own, as the <hi>Samaritans</hi> wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed, and ſaid, <hi>John</hi> 4.42. unto the Woman, <hi>Now we Believe, not becauſe of thy ſaying, but becauſe we have heard him our ſelves, and know that this is indeed the Chriſt, the Saviour of the World:</hi> And as he himſelf ſaid to <hi>Thomas, Reach hither thy Hand, and thruſt it into my Side.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So this Soul hath it not by bare hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay, but he feels the Agony of his Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings

            <p>So you ſee the Servants of the Lord could not be Satisfied with any thing leſs than Victory over all Sin and Iniquity: And that great Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> after his ſtrong Warfares and weary Travels, gives this account, that he had not been beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Air, but had ſo fought as to obtain the Crown: I <hi>thank God,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>thro' Chriſt, who hath given me the Victory.</hi> It was through Chriſt he obtained it, thro'

            <p>A Rock of Offence indeed to them that gets above it. This Holy Croſs, which he Glorified ſo much in, that Crucified him to the World, and the World to him; that was his Glory, the Victory that he had got over the World, and he returns Thanks to God, who had given it him through Chriſt, through thoſe Soul-Sufferings which <hi>Paul</hi> had ſo great a ſhare in, and which was Chriſt in him the hope of Glory: So <hi>Paul</hi> was made One with Chriſt, by his Internal and Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Sufferings; and here our Bleſſed Lord's Prayer was anſwered, when he ſaid, <hi>Father that they may be One, as we are One; I in them, and thou in me; that they may be made perfect in One: Father I will that they which thou haſt given me, be with me, even where I am; that they may behold my Glory.</hi>

Will Chriſt's Obedience to the Father perfect the Soul's Work, without the Soul's Obedience to Chriſt? The Law in it ſelf made nothing perfect; but Chriſt, being the End of the Law, the Law was fulfill'd in him; be thou holy, Chriſt was holy; be thou perfect, Chriſt was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; ſo he was the Perfection of the Law, in him the Law was perfected: Here Chriſt hath done the Will of God, <hi>Lo I come, as it is written of me, to do thy Will, O God:</hi> Now Chriſt hath fulfilled all that was commanded the Creature in the Law; is there nothing now for Man to do?

            <p>Here are the words of Chriſt fulfill'd; here was a Man that was a Partaker of all his Precious Promiſes; here was he that was made Ruler over all that he had; here was Two that were gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his Name, and he in the midſt of them; here, were the Faithful Servants, who, when their Lord came, were found waiting, for Him to give them their Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Meat in due Seaſon; the firſt had attained to Regeneration, and the New-Birth, to Perfection it ſelf, he was come to the Power and Kingdom of God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in him, by which Power in him, he could ſo govern and command all his inward and outward Senſes, that all the Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Powers of the Old Man in his Soul, were conquered, and brought into ſubjection to the New Man in him: Here
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:173009:74"/>was a Man that witneſſed to the Power of Chriſt actually in him, and not in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit as Formal Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>The ſecond was <hi>John Thaulerus</hi> himſelf, (if we may believe the Ancient Copies) who, by the ſpace of Eight Years, had continually importuned the Lord by Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, conceiving he wanted the right Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Truth, notwithſtanding all his Learning, and ſpent whole Nights therein, begging of God to let him know Him, and know himſelf.</p>
            <p>If I may be ſo bold as to ask you, how many ſuch Learned Divines comes out of your Schools of <hi>Oxford</hi> and <hi>Cambridge,</hi> that notwithſtanding all their Learning, goes back again into their own Nothing, and becomes as a little Child to learn their <hi>A,</hi> B, <hi>C,</hi> crying, <hi>Father, ſhew me, teach me, the Way of Truth, which is to know Thee, and to know my ſelf?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Divine, as the Hiſtory ſtiles him, did he go to Man for this Knowledge of God and himſelf? No; but to God only; for he had all the Learning Man could give; he had been at the Univerſities, from whence he had the Title, <hi>A Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Divine;</hi> yet, you ſee here, he was as
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:173009:74"/>Ignorant of the true Saving Knowledge, as he who was a Ruler in <hi>Iſrael</hi> was of the New-Birth; yet had a Belief of Chriſt that he was the Meſſiah; ſo it was with the Learned <hi>John Thaulerus,</hi> he had an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Hiſtorical Faith of God in Chriſt, but that would not do with him now, when the Spirit in him was making ſearch after the deep things of God, to know Him, and to know himſelf; which is a Key to open the Cabinet of Divine Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, the higheſt Knowledge Man can at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to in this Life; <hi>for to know God is Life Eternal:</hi> And that Soul who truly knows God, in and through Jeſus Chriſt, ſhall quickly know it ſelf, and be made to cry out, <hi>Wo is me, for</hi> I <hi>am undone; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe</hi> I <hi>am a Man of polluted Lips, and</hi> I <hi>dwell in the midſt of a polluted People, for mine Eyes have ſeen the King, and Lord of Hoſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But then again, Oh thou Soul, this is the very ſtate, in the Sence of thy own Nothingneſs, where thy Lips ſhall be touched with a Coal from the Altar, which ſhall take away thy Iniquity, and then thou wilt be ready to go on the Lord's Errand, tho' dreadful, <hi>Go unto

Surely till his Locks are wet with the Dew of the Night, till his Holy Spirit is weary with Striving, and then the Breath ceaſeth from before him, which he hath made; <hi>Then ſhall they Call, but I will not hear; for us I called, and they would not hear; ſo ſhall they call, and I will not hear them,</hi> ſaith the Lord; <hi>then ſhall their Seers be aſhamed, and their Diviners confounded, when they ſhall have no
